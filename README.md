# weather-forecasting
In this project, we'll predict tomorrow's temperature and weather using python and historical data. We'll start by downloading a dataset of local weather by BMKG.
Then, we'll clean the data and get it ready for machine learning. We'll build a system to make historical predictions, and add more predictors to improve the model.  We'll end with how to make next-day predictions.
